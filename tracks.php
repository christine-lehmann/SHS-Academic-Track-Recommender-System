                        <p>General Academic Strand is great for students who are still 
                           undecided on which track to take. You can choose electives 
                           from the different academic strands under this track.<br><br>
                        </p>

                              GAS subjects are a mix of specialized subjects from the other three strands: 
                              Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) Strand,  Science, Technology, Engineering 
                              and Mathematics (STEM) Strand, and Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM) 
                              Strand and other tracks offered for Senior High School students.
                           </p>
                           <div class="row">

                                 Your choice of profession is as flexible as this strand. Basically, you can choose 
                                 any possible profession from the other three strands. But take note that your chosen 
                                 profession would likely depend on the specialized subjects, especially the electives, 
                                 you decided to study.<br><br>

                       <p>The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) strand 
                        focuses on the science or body of knowledge behind many things. 
                        There's a science to almost everything.<br><br>
                       </p>

                              Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics are intertwining 
                              disciplines when applied in the real world. The difference of the 
                              STEM curriculum with the other strands and tracks is the focus on 
                              advanced concepts and topics.
                           </p>

                                 Under the track, you can become a pilot, an architect, an astrophysicist, 
                                 a biologist, a chemist, an engineer, a dentist, a nutritionist, a nurse, a doctor, 
                                 and a lot more. Those who are also interested in Marine Engineering should take this 
                                 track.<br><br>
